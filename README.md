# Explorer Marathon Projects 🪐

### 🚀 Marathon 3.0

Project for this edition consisted of creating a menu that would be available online and also generate a QR Code for it.

My customization was inspired by the theme of the Stranger Things series, for more details, access the readme in the MarExplorer3 folder.
